### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false

###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

[meta]
  dir = "/var/opt/influxdb/meta"
  hostname = "localhost"
  bind-address = ":8088"
  retention-autocreate = true
  election-timeout = "1s"
  heartbeat-timeout = "1s"
  leader-lease-timeout = "500ms"
  commit-timeout = "50ms"

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  dir = "/var/opt/influxdb/data"
  max-wal-size = 104857600 # Maximum size the WAL can reach before a flush. Defaults to 100MB.
  wal-flush-interval = "10m" # Maximum time data can sit in WAL before a flush.
  wal-partition-flush-delay = "2s" # The delay time between each WAL partition being flushed.

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

[cluster]
  shard-writer-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a shard must respond to write.
  write-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a write operation must complete on the cluster.

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "10m"

###
### [admin]
###
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface. If HTTPS is
### enabled for the admin interface, HTTPS must also be enabled on the [http] service.
###

[admin]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8083"
  https-enabled = false
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
###

[http]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8086"
  auth-enabled = true
  log-enabled = true
  write-tracing = false
  pprof-enabled = false
  https-enabled = false
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

###
### [[graphite]]
###
### Controls one or many listeners for Graphite data.
###

[[graphite]]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ":2003"
  # protocol = "tcp"
  # consistency-level = "one"
  # name-separator = "."

  ## "name-schema" configures tag names for parsing the metric name from graphite protocol;
  ## separated by `name-separator`.
  ## The "measurement" tag is special and the corresponding field will become
  ## the name of the metric.
  ## e.g. "type.host.measurement.device" will parse "server.localhost.cpu.cpu0" as
  ## {
  ##     measurement: "cpu",
  ##     tags: {
  ##         "type": "server",
  ##         "host": "localhost,
  ##         "device": "cpu0"
  ##     }
  ## }
  # name-schema = "type.host.measurement.device"

  ## If set to true, when the input metric name has more fields than `name-schema` specified,
  ## the extra fields will be ignored.
  ## Otherwise an error will be logged and the metric rejected.
  # ignore-unnamed = true

###
### [collectd]
###
### Controls the listener for collectd data.
###

[collectd]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ""
  # database = ""
  # typesdb = ""

###
### [opentsdb]
###
### Controls the listener for OpenTSDB data.
###

[opentsdb]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ""
  # database = ""
  # retention-policy = ""

###
### [udp]
###
### Controls the listener for InfluxDB line protocol data via UDP.
###

[udp]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ""
  # database = ""
  # batch-size = 0
  # batch-timeout = "0"

###
### [monitoring]
###

[monitoring]
  enabled = false

###
### [continuous_queries]
###
### Controls how continuous queries are run within InfluxDB.
###

[continuous_queries]
  enabled = true
  recompute-previous-n = 2
  recompute-no-older-than = "10m"
  compute-runs-per-interval = 10
  compute-no-more-than = "2m"

###
### [hinted-handoff]
###
### Controls the hinted handoff feature, which allows nodes to temporarily
### store queued data when one node of a cluster is down for a short period
### of time.
###

[hinted-handoff]
  enabled = true
  dir = "/var/opt/influxdb/hh"
